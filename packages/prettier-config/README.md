# `@antlered-viking/prettier-config`

PrettierRC, as configured by Antlered Viking

---

## Usage

First install the package as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D @antlered-viking/prettier-config
# or if you use yarn
yarn add -D @antlered-viking/prettier-config
```

Once the package finishes installing, it will automatically update your package.json to start using Prettier right away.

```bash
npm run format # if you use NPM
yarn run format # if you use Yarn
```

That's actually it! Now your project is set up to use this prettier configuration, and it has a new `format` script in your `package.json` file you can use going forward.
